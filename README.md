Here will sit some Wolfram Models/Hypergraphs using Wolfram Script/Mathematica and SetReplace.  They may or may not represent the actual Universe.  :)

Update:  Haven't done anything with this (obviously) but continue to closely follow the project.  Some notable existential implications that have emerged...

Hypothesis/Conjecture:  Rather than existing on a folation/reference frame in the Ruliad/Rulial space it may have cooled down/reduced/compressed and converged/crystalized into the stable, balanced structure that we experience today as our palpable Universe (and the physics therein).  I have no data or formulation to back this up and it's entirely intuitive at this point. One could possibly think of the concept a bit like this: if the Ruliad is a game space, our Universe is a (pseudo?) Nash equilibria or some other kind of optima.  Or maybe not.  It's fun to think about.
