Here will sit some Wolfram Models/Hypergraphs using Wolfram Script/Mathematica and SetReplace.  They may or may not represent the actual Universe.  :)

Update:  Haven't done anything with this (obviously) but continue to closely follow the project.  Some notable existential implications that have emerged...

And, even more interesting realizations... We might exist on a foliation in a much higher dimensional Universe (Rulial space), mediated/canonized down to roughly 3D by the particles of which we're comprised and/or maybe just computational boundedness.

In so many words, what we perceive as time dilation in Special Relativity (which has to do with computational boundedness in Wolfram Models) might also be why we only perceive a limited/canonized rule-set in a Rulial Space, effectively averaging three dimensions.  Time dilation ~ rule canonization.

Similar to working with game abstractions in poker, one has to reduce the game size in order to fit it into available resources and time constraints, usually done via some kind of manual canonization or "bucketing" of cards and/or game trees into strategically similar groups using various statistical methods.  

The Universe (or just math itself) is doing this naturally, as an intrinsic result of being in a reference frame in Rulial Space.  I'm not sure if they've figured out the equations to this yet, but it seems likely it would be an analog of SR/GR, as was the case with the Feynman Path Integral in Branchial Space.

Further, our particles may be the perceived "quanta" of that canonization and/or some other process of math acting on itself.  Certain properties of the Standard Model may be universal, beyond gauge invariance.  In the same sense that SR/GR exist fundamentally everywhere in Rulial Space due to causal invariance and computational boundedness, so might the structure of particles.  In the same breath that Wolfram asked: "Why these rules and not others?"  I'm wondering: "why these particles and not others?"

Do we experience/perceive things a certain way (e.g 3D) because we're comprised of certain particles (which don't interact strongly with what would be a plethora of other particles in Rulial space), or do our particles exist this way because of a reference frame in Rulial space, or some intersection of the two, or something else?

It might all just be a story of boundedness, and math doing math.

Further abstract thoughts: The act of commuting/computing is "observing."  The question of data versus code is a question of stationary versus computation.

Evolution might not have started with cells:

... 'leading to a limiting “equilibrium” probability distribution.'  

It might be the particles in the Standard Model were the dominant genomes, at least in our reference frame in the Ruliad.
